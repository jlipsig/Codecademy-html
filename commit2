Introduction to HTML

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

  <head></head>

</html>

Learn

So far you've done two things:

    Declared to the browser that your code is HTML.
    Added the HTML element (<html>) that will contain the rest of your code.

Let's also give the browser some information about the page. We can do this by adding a <head> element.

The <head> element contains the metadata for a web page. Metadata is information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the web page. You'll see an example of this in the next exercise.

The opening and closing head tags (<head></head>) typically appear as the first item after your first HTML tag.
Instructions

The empty <head> element is placed within the opening and closing <html> tags.
